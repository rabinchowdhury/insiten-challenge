          <p>This was made using the following technologies: HTML, CSS, SASS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, React (Axios, React Router, Recharts) and Redux. You can find the code repository for this project on my <a href="https://github.com/rabinchowdhury/insiten-challenge">GitHub</a> page. I'm constantly trying to improve as a front-end developer, and so any feedback will be appreciated. I'm working to learn about back-end technologies like Node.JS (Express.JS) and MongoDB so that I can incorporate them into my projects. Wow, if you made it this far, you're awesome. I love web technologies. My love for web technologies started when I was applying some sick styling to my Myspace page. I'm from a generation that was raised by the internet (hello, 2007 Runescape). This is really a labor of love. <b>Thank you, Insiten Team, for giving me the opportunity to show off my sick (maybe not) skills. </b> I'll leave you with my favorite quote.</p>
          <p>"The credit belongs to the man who spends himself in a worthy cause;  who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly.‚Äù - Theodore Roosevelt</p>
